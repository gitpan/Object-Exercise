    Minor change in use arg's: -e [optinal name], 
    -b [optinal name] allow exporting both exercise
    and benchmark with alternate names; drops -n
    switch (which only handles one of them).

    Split into separate modules for benchmark, execute 
    operation. Avoids loading benchmark module if it 
    won't be used; pushed common variables and utility
    subs into separate module.

    eval use Time::HiRes then Benchmark qw( :hireswallclock ).
    If that fails then use Benchmark without the hireswallclock.

    Require Benchmark-1.07, which handles issues with 
    missing Time::HiRes properly.

    Remove begin hacks for dealing with missing Time::HiRes.
